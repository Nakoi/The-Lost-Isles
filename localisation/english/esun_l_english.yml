 esu_start.0.d:0 "The Sacred Temple of Chubu was often held as a place of quiet worship, where any kirin may go to bask in the divinity of the Director Above and meditate on their place within the World Play. Though it was often held to be an insult to the Gods to dispell this tranquility, there were exceptions in times of great celebration... or in times of politics. In a tradition dating back a bit over two centuries, the politicians of our nation have made it a point to speak in front of this most Holy of Temples in order to lay out their beliefs not just to the common citizenry, but to Chubu Himself. In keeping with tradition, the widely popular canidate of the Liberty Party undertook a pilgrimage to the Temple to expound their ideas to mortal and divine alike.\n\n'Kirin, ponies, and other creatures alike! I come here today, in the presence of the Divine, to speak to you about the universal truths upon which our very Republic was founded. Let me remind you of how our founders, who sought nothing but their own freedom before the Gods, were oppressed and persecuted within our ancestral land. Did they then give up upon their dreams, lay down their blades, and surrender themselves to those who would see them killed for what they believe? If they had, I would not be standing before you today as a free kirin.'\n\n'Instead, they left for lands unknown, across an uncertain sea with no clear idea of what terrors would await them on the other side. Yet what they found here was not just a dangerous wilderness, but instead a bountiful and prosperous land gifted to us by the Gods, upon which they sought to build our Republic. They were blessed for their exile, rather than punished for daring to oppose the authorities which sought to oppress them.'\n\n'Yet in recent years, it seems many within our holy nation would have spit upon our founders and their ideals - the very ideals favored by the Gods themselves! I hear your protests now, but let me ask you this... How is it right that we should treat ponykind, our dear siblings who only seek to play their part within the World Play, with nothing but contempt when their situation has grown so similar to our own? Do they not now seek to flee an oppressive regime, to seek a new land of freedom and harmony, just as we once did?'\n\n'The next time you see a pony in your neighborhood, I want you to remember that their situation is not so foreign to us. Appreciate them and embrace them, for they are blessed in their exile and perhaps one day they too shall forge a new homeland to call their own. Thank you.'"
 esu_start.0.a:0 "For the true principles!"
  
 esu_start.1.t:0 "To Cleanse a Nation"
 esu_start.1.d:0 "Many politicians have sought to use the recent tensions for their own gain, but few have been as successful as LEADERNAME, the founder, leader, and canidate of the National Rebirth Party. The NRP holds faith, order, and purity above all. As their influence and sway has grown, they've also found themselves capable of supporting their own political militia organization - the so-called 'Blue Flames', named for many of their most zealous members tendency to turn into niriks at the slightest provocation. With the election well underway, a public rally by the NRP was not unexpected, but few could foresee the form it would take.\n\n'We demand you leave our land! We demand you leave our land!' These chants and many more rang out across the capital city of Kurida, as tens of thousands of kirin marched through the city streets. Commerce had been slowed to a halt, numerous otherwise bustling marketplaces were closed, and any ponies unfortunate enough to find themselves out in the mess were often harassed or outright assaulted by the reactionary mobs. In the midst of it all, the Kurdian Central Police struggled to maintain order.\n\nIn one particular incident, a group of Blue Flames broke into, vandalized, and looted a store belonging to an elderly pony couple. The ponies were saved from any further violence against them by the rapid response of law enforcement, and that would had been the end of this incident, if not for the subsequent arrival of LEADERNAME.Standing before their followers, they glared at the police standing in front of the recently assaulted business before speaking.\n\n'Look now at the lizard-blooded dogs who protect these invaders! Do you see what our government does, what our elected officials allow? Violence, directed not against the vermin who infest our streets and steal our money while our poor starve, but against upstanding kirin who would give their lives to help our great nation! No more, no more, I say! Ponykind will never again be welcome here, after they dared reveal their true nature as scoundrels and theives, as criminals and swindlers, as invaders and parasites! Our founders built a land for kirin and by kirin, as blessed by the Gods Above! To tarnish their ideals by allowing such filth to plague us is an affront to all that is Holy! Soon, we shall reclaim our nation, reclaim our pride, and reclaim our future!'\n\nWith his impromptu speeches conclusion, LEADER led the gathered crowd further into the capital and away from the storefront, much to the relief of the vastly outnumbered police protecting it."
 esu_start.1.a:0 "The cheers could be heard across the city."
 
 esu_start.2.t:0 "The Day of Fire and Flame"
 esu_start.2.d:0 "The city of Yorii was a particularly diverse one, being home to the single largest population of ponies within the nation. It was also renown for it's relatively lax voting laws, allowing a far higher amount of the population to vote than any other city. Their location close to the border with Avtukov has also led to them becoming home to a sizable armory, weapons manufacturing sector, and military infrastructure. All this combined made it a critical city for the nation, but the National Rebirth Party would again catch most of the nation by surprise when they concentrated most of their forces there on election day, rather than in the more strategic and populated Kurida. Though the reason for this would soon become apparent.\n\nIt started simply enough and in a way which most would expect. Several violent protests occured across the city, with partipants encouraged to take out their woes on any ponies that could be found. Voting booths were often patrolled by Blue Flames, who would harass and often outright assault any ponies trying to cast their own votes. Several standoffs against the local police occured throughout the morning, but the NRP rabble rousers often conceeded and dispersed under pressure from law enforcement. That is, until the afternoon.\n\nWhat began as yet another standoff with the by-then very overworked law enforcement took a turn for the worse with the arrival of another local militia - the Liberty Party affiliated Ootarian Unification Front. The situation then quickly escalated into an allout brawl between the two forces, with the police being caught in the middle of it. All across the city, similar situations began to play out, and the violence steadily escalated until the point of full blown riots and attacks against government buildings.\n\nIt wasn't long before the local military garrison was being deployed to help protect local officials and support law enforcement. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the NRP wanted. With the garrison stretched thin, they were unable to effectively respond when the Blue Flames stormed the Yorii Armory, one of the most well stocked and modern in the nation. The small force left protecting the armory fought against the unexpected attack with fury and zeal, and in doing so they were..."

 esu_event.0.t:0 "The Election Results"
 esu_event.0.d:0 "The Yorii Situation was resolved after a night of blood and terror, as the combination of the garrison and police proved to be enough to restore order. Thousands were detained, stretching the local jails to well beyond their limit and forcing the city government to establish several temporary holding areas. Numerous ponies and kirin alike were killed in the fighting with immense damage being done across the city. In response to all this carnage, a day of rememberance was declared across the nation. Due to their role in promoting, participating in, and causing the violence, the National Rebirth Party was declared an illegitimate political organization and suspended by an Emergency Act of Parliament. With this, the Liberty Party was cemented as the new leaders of Esun.\n\nIn his inauguration address, LEADERNAME promised that those responsible for the tragedy in Yorii would all be brought to justice and went on to call for a period of mourning for those lives lost within the chaos. Outlining the shocking horrors of the conflict, they also called for sanity to be restored across the nation and for kirin to join hooves with ponykind in friendship rather than allow themselves to devolve to such barbarism."

 esu_event.00.t:0 "The Election Results"
 esu_event.00.d:0 "After a night of violent and brutal fighting across the city, the National Rebirth Party and it's associated forces emerged as the clear victor thanks in no small part to the numerous muskets and spears provided to them by the capture of the Yorii Armory. Countless pony neighborhoods were razed to the ground, numerous public officials and law enforcement officers were killed, and the local garrison was largely scattered to the winds. As the sole victor, the NRP's official stance as correlated by numerous ponies supportive of their movement was that the Liberty Party started the escalation of violence through the OUF, who quickly joined forces with local pony gangs and sought to violently force a result in the election. Fortunately, the brave and upstanding members of the Blue Flame were ready to stand up for their nations democratic traditions. Through a night of heoric battle, they reclaimed the city and dealt with the threat to their society. Of course, given that they only fought in the name of democracy, it is only right that they made sure to preserve as many votes as possible. Votes which overwhelmingly faovred the NRP.\n\nDespite heavy protests from several members of Parliament, it was decided to accept the Yorii votes. Due to them, the NRP has managed to win the national election by a slim marging. In his inauguration address, LEADERNAME thanked the upstanding kirin of the nation for their faith and promised to show the same faith in them, as he led the nation forward into a bright blessed future. A future devoid of corruption, of fear, of poverty, and of ponies."
