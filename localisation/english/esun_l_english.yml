###POLITICAL PARTIES###


###FOCUS LOCALISATION - NORMIE###
 ESU_Upcoming_elections:0 "Upcoming Elections"
 ESU_Upcoming_elections_desc:0 "At the center of our ideals is the concept of democracy - our kirin choosing their own leader rather than one being mandated by birth. While this system has served us well for centuries, we are currently faced with what may be one of the most contentious elections in our history. No matter the outcome, it will be an interesting one."
 ESU_visionarism:0 "The Era of Unity"
 ESU_visionarism_desc:0 "Violence and bloodshed will only bring about the destruction of our nation and ideals. This is a time not for conflict, but instead for peace and cooperation among our people. We will march into the future together, not apart."
 ESU_pony_rights:0 "Outlaw Discrimination"
 ESU_pony_rights_desc:0 "For too long now, we have turned a blind eye to blatant discrimination against a sizable deal of our population. No more! From this moment onwards, the official stance of our nation will be firmly opposed to unfair treatment of any kind towards our pony friends."
 ESU_old_relations:0 "Treaty on the Partition of the Central Unorganized Territory"
 ESU_old_relations_desc:0 "While the more zealous within our nation firmly believe in our ability to subjugate the southern warlords, the reality is nowhere near as generous as they believe it to be. The sad truth is we currently lack the means to confidently take and occupy the entire south, not to mention the geopolitical issues with doing so. In order to ease these burdens, we will cut a deal with some of our similarly minded neighbors."
 ESU_give_them_jobs:0 "Jobs for Ponies"
 ESU_give_them_jobs_desc:0 "A not unsizable number of our ponies face difficulties with finding stable employment, due to both the economic situation of their communities and the unfair hiring practices that are commonplace across the nation. We will solve this issue through a series of economic investments and the expansion of pony-run factories across our nation."
 ESU_booming_industry:0 "Booming Industry"
 ESU_booming_industry_desc:0 "We can't allow our economy to fall behind those of our neighbors. Extensive economic investment is necessary if we are to ensure that we remain competitive within the global market."
 ESU_Infrastructure_rework:0 "Cobbled Roads"
 ESU_Infrastructure_rework_desc:0 "Uniting our nation through words is good and all, but if we wish to truly bring about unity we must connect it in a far more physical manner. From Shunsho to Nigoriike, the roads of Esun will carry kirin, ponies, and goods alike."
 ESU_pony_work_acceptance:0 "Pony Worker Acceptance"
 ESU_pony_work_acceptance_desc:0 "Most kirin employers within our nation would still prefer a purely kirin workforce, even at the cost of being understaffed or delaying expansion. To correct this, we must launch a campaign aimed at promoting widespread acceptance of pony employees."
 ESU_biger_workforce:0 "Incorporate Pony Industries"
 ESU_biger_workforce_desc:0 "The social isolation of pony communities within our borders has led to them developing their own 'shadow economy', which has until now remained largely seperated from our national commerce. We will ensure that these illegitimate businesses are brought up to code and legitimized, so that they may contribute to our economy and country."
 ESU_industry_investment:0 "Industrial Modernization"
 ESU_industry_investment_desc:0 "Industry is always advancing, with new tools, techniques, and machines being devised constantly to improve production. We will begin investing in these innovations to ensure that our economy remains both modern and competitive."
 ESU_mining_operations:0 "Re-Open the Northern Iron Mines"
 ESU_mining_operations_desc:0 "Ozaki used to be home to numerous extensive iron mines. Unfortunately, due to economic downturn and tensions at the nearby Avtukov border, most of these mines have long since closed down. This won't do at all, and so we are subsidizing the reopening of many of the mines across the region."
 ESU_farming_operations:0 "Chemical Fertiliser"
 ESU_farming_operations_desc:0 "Some of our finest minds have come up with an amazing new type of fertiliser, far more efficient and nutritious than typical traditional fertilisers. We will invest in the mass production and distribution of it in order to ensure that our food supply continues to steadily grow alongside our population."
 ESU_lumber_operations:0 "The Golden Timberfellers"
 ESU_lumber_operations_desc:0 "Several years back, the presence of gold within the Koyo region led to many hopeful kirin making their way there to pursue their dream of striking it rich. Unfortunately for them, the small amounts of gold found alongside a river bank was all that ended up being found. Since then, the city of Koyo has remained burdened by a sizable impoverished population. To help rectify this, we will open a number of lumbermills nearby and encourage the failed prospectors to seek employment with them."
 ESU_boat_industry:0 "The Shipwrights of the Eastern Refuge"
 ESU_boat_industry_desc:0 "The sea remains an invaluable route for trade, along with a source of many of the Gods blessings to us. To help ensure it remains secure, we will invest in the expansion of numerous shipyards along the coast."
 ESU_clan_industry:0 "Southern Industry"
 ESU_clan_industry_desc:0 "While it would be inappropriate to call those regions bordering the Clan Lands destitute, they are certainly underdeveloped in many ways. To correct this, we will begin a series of widespread economic investments aimed at increasing their local industry and providing jobs for those living there."
 ESU_pony_education:0 "Pony Education"
 ESU_pony_education_desc:0 "Pony schools are usually small, community run, and get little to no support from the local government. It is crucial that we improve this situation as much as we possibly can, through both integrating pony foals into our traditional schooling system and through investing in many of their community schools to bring them up to modern national standards."
 ESU_pony_regiments:0 "Seperate All-Pony Battalions"
 ESU_pony_regiments_desc:0 "Despite us having no shortage of ponies willing to fight against their oppressive homeland, our recruitment practices and military culture have thus far made that unfeasible for many. While trying to force our soldiers to accept ponies alongside them would lead to no shortage of issues, we can instead form purely pony battallions where they can prove themselves and their loyalty to our nation."
 ESU_pony_officers:0 "Ponies led by Ponies"
 ESU_pony_officers_desc:0 "Until now, ponies have been barred from holding commanding officer position within our military. We are happy to announce that this policy has been rendered a relic of the past, as numerous ponies are now finding themselves placed in command of their fellows. Alongside this, we have begun integrating ponies of merit across our entire military, allowing them to play their part despite their differences."
 ESU_army_training:0 "Proper Barracks"
 ESU_army_training_desc:0 "We wouldn't expect a kirin to live in a disease ridden ratsnest of an encampment with barely a tent as its only shelter. Why would we expect that of a pony? It's long past time that we brought proper sanitation, real shelter, and essential facilities to all of our military fortifications, be they kirin or pony."
 ESU_ponies_and_kirins_for_our_nation:0 "Two Races Under One Flag"
 ESU_ponies_and_kirins_for_our_nation_desc:0 "While our Blessed Republic may have been founded by one race, we have now found ourselves home to another. Yet despite our differences, we have come together in unity and bonded through oru shared ideals. There is no longer pony or kirin - just Esun, and the citizens of it. We live together, fight together, and will ultimately die together if it means bringing about our shared future of prosperity. "
 ESU_ideas_of_vengence:0 "To Strive Forevermore!"
 ESU_ideas_of_vengence_desc:0 "Our nation now marches on with our chins up and our hopes high. Truly, the Gods have blessed us, for we can see nothing but the brightness of the future that lay ahead."
 
 ESU_eyes_on_the_clans:0 "Eyes on the Interior"
 ESU_eyes_on_the_clans_desc:0 "For too long, the petty clans led by their equally petty warlords have reigned across our rightful southern lands. It's long past time we did something about it, beginning with our preliminary preparations towards a proper lawbringing operation down there. Soldiers must be mustered, muskets must be cleaned, and plans must be drafted if we are to effectively claim those anarchistic realms."
 ESU_envoys_to_the_clans:0 "Bring Forth Civilisation"
 ESU_envoys_to_the_clans_desc:0 "Countless kirin have suffered under the incompetent and corrupt hooves of the warlords. No more! By the will of the Gods, we shall reclaim those lands which are rightfully ours. We shall bring to them civility and peace, no matter the cost."
 ESU_talks_with_Hriki:0 "Civilise Clan Hriki Territory"
 ESU_talks_with_Hriki_desc:0 "Hriki has been a particular thorn in our side for generations now, with their constant raids on our southern borders presenting a continuous threat to us. No longer! Now their warlord is cast down and their clan shattered, allowing us to properly settle their lands."
 ESU_talks_with_Waonto:0 "Civilise Clan Waonto Territory"
 ESU_talks_with_Waonto_desc:0 "Smugglers and black market dealers have been allowed to thrive within Clan Waonto's territory, with their leaders serving more as criminal bosses than warlords. With our newfound occupation of them, we can finally set about establishing the rule of law."
 ESU_talks_with_onki:0 "Civilise Clan Onki Territory"
 ESU_talks_with_onki_desc:0 "Clan Onki was the beating heart of the uncivilized interior, serving as both the closest thing to a trading hub within the territory and enriching themselves through their conflicts with all of the clans around them. Bringing order to their former territory would go a long way towards cementing our control in the region."
 ESU_talks_with_azeo:0 "Civilise Clan Azeo Territory"
 ESU_talks_with_azeo_desc:0 "For too long, the Mountain Clan of Azeo has stood as an unshakeable wall against our ambition of uniting the Ootari lands. Yet their mountain holds finally fell and their lines crumbled before our blessed armies. Now, those very same holds can be used to consolidate our control over their land."
 ESU_acquire_weapons:0 "Acquire Weapons"
 ESU_acquire_weapons_desc:0 "Numerous armories were built across our land to house reserve weaponry, for use in times of conflict. With war on the horizon, the time has finally come to tap into these reserves so as to make sure our soldiers can be armed when they charge down the enemy lines."
 ESU_amnesty_for_their_soldiers:0 "Amnesty for Their Soldiers"
 ESU_amnesty_for_their_soldiers_desc:0 "While the southern warlords may be a mix of criminals, radicals, and brutal tyrants, the poor kirin under them were simply forced by circumstance or birth into following them. We should hold no ill will towards our kin. Instead, we must spread our hooves wide and welcome them back into the fold as brothers and sisters."
 ESU_no_forgiveness:0 "No Forgiveness"
 ESU_no_forgiveness_desc:0 "Raiders, criminals, and monsters occupy the southern lands. While their leaders may have been dealt with, the time has now come to enact true justice upon all those who followed them. Let each and every sin be brought to light, as we make it clear that we uphold the law above all else."
 ESU_restore_control:0 "Western Wall"
 ESU_restore_control_desc:0 "The griffons to the west remain a concern for our ever-growing empire. In preparation for a potential conflict with them, we must invest heavily into the fortification of our western border."
 ESU_crush_them_all:0 "Crush them All"
 ESU_crush_them_all_desc:0 "Petty warlords and common criminals are all that occupy our rightful southern lands, as they continue to feast thanks to the harvest that is rightfully ours. No more! With Kita as our witness, they shall be brought down before our blades and forced to see justice!"
 ESU_enslave_them:0 "Enslave Them"
 ESU_enslave_them_desc:0 "It is only fitting that these rats and thieves should be forced to repay our society for all they've stolen. Let it be known that from this moment onwards, they and their descendants are less than true kirin until the day their lineages finally pay off their debts to the Gods."
 ESU_redemption_through_blood:0 "Redemption Through Blood"
 ESU_redemption_through_blood_desc:0 "With Kita's blessing, we have overcome the foe and reclaimed our lands. To honor Him, we shall resurrect one of His most ancient and worshipful traditions: Redemption through service."
 ESU_deal_with_sunotian_imperialism:0 "Deal with the Godless Griffons"
 ESU_deal_with_sunotian_imperialism_desc:0 "Long ago, the wretched and moralless griffonkind sought to exploit our people. Now, we shall repay them in kind. Let their armies fall before our righteous might!"

 ESU_send_troops_to_the_front:0 "Universal Conscription"
 ESU_send_troops_to_the_front_desc:0 "It is the duty of every true God-fearing kirin to serve their country to their fullest ability. For some, this may be through working a field or toiling in a factory. Yet for many more, this will be through holding a rifle and marching in an orderly line towards our foes. We will need many capable soldiers if we are to put an end to the pony threat once and for all."
 ESU_drive_the_ponies_outs:0 "Drive the Ponies Out!"
 ESU_drive_the_ponies_outs_desc:0 "They invest our towns, invade our cities, and bring with them nothing but ruin. It is time to reclaim our nation, to show all ponykind that they are not and never will be welcome here among us. For Esun belongs to the kirin!"
 ESU_no_protests:0 "No Protests"
 ESU_no_protests_desc:0 "It pains us to admit it, but many of our otherwise upstanding kirin have been subverted and corrupted by pony lies. They now openly align with them, defending them against their necessary removal and even trying to help them in anyway they can. Despite their objections, we will do what must be done. And any who throw their lot in with the fiendish ponies shall be treated like ponies."
 ESU_our_ruler_is_right:0 "Our Dear Leader is Always Right"
 ESU_our_ruler_is_right_desc:0 "Pony communities? Ponies in the workplace? Ponies in the temples!? These are unthinkable attrocities against all that our founders sought to accomplish! Yet the craven and weak within our nation would have this become normalized. We know better though. [Root.GetLeader] knows better! And as she wills it, we shall make sure nopony ever taints our blessed land ever again."
 ESU_start_the_warmachine:0 "Arm our New Troops"
 ESU_start_the_warmachine_desc:0 "Bodies are good, but they are largely useless without weapons to wield.

 ESU_weapon_supplies:0 "A Sea of Spears"
 ESU_weapon_supplies_desc:0 "We need more! More! More spears, more guns, more food! Our army is only growing and its needs will only grow with it. We will raid every stockpile, every armory, and every basement if we must to secure a supply for our troops."
 ESU_workforce_overdrive:0 "Workforce Overdrive"
 ESU_workforce_overdrive_desc:0 "The kirin of today are lazy, more likely to slack off than to put in the effort necessary to serve their country. No longer! Through harsh quotas, harsher forekirin, and a wide variety of production incentives, we shall ensure that every labourer is willing to give it their all to drive our industry forward. Or else."
 ESU_infrastructure_expansion:0 "Improve our Supply Line"
 ESU_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Much of our nation has gone underdeveloped due to the corrupt and uncaring attitude of our former government.

 ESU_disarm_the_citizenry:0 "Disarm the Citizenry"
 ESU_disarm_the_citizenry_desc:0 "Many kirin would selfishly hoard weapons to themselves while our soldiers struggle to even find a fork with which to fight the enemy. Well, enough is enough!

We must all be willing to give everything in service to the Gods and to the nation!"
 ESU_militarisation_of_the_state:0 "Complete Militarisation of the State"

Be it through natural settlement or those seeking refuge from our eastern neighbor, their population has only continued to grow overtime. This has always caused some societal tension, but things have begun to turn for the worse as of late due in no small part to the growing international concern towards Avtukov. The official stance of our Republic remains one of friendship and reconciliation towards them. However, several influential kirin within our nation have taken to blaming ponykind for most of the problems we face today and have found considerable support through calling for action to be taken instead in order to curb what they claim to be a growing threat to our way of life."

 esu_start.0.d:0 "The Sacred Temple of Chubu was often held as a place of quiet worship, where any kirin may go to bask in the divinity of the Director Above and meditate on their place within the World Play. Though it was often held to be an insult to the Gods to dispell this tranquility, there were exceptions in times of great celebration... or in times of politics. In a tradition dating back a bit over two centuries, the politicians of our nation have made it a point to speak in front of this most Holy of Temples in order to lay out their beliefs not just to the common citizenry, but to Chubu Himself. In keeping with tradition, the widely popular canidate of the Liberty Party, Apple Forest, undertook a pilgrimage to the Temple to expound his ideas to mortal and divine alike.\n\n'Kirin, ponies, and other creatures alike! I come here today, in the presence of the Divine, to speak to you about the universal truths upon which our very Republic was founded. Let me remind you of how our founders, who sought nothing but their own freedom before the Gods, were oppressed and persecuted within our ancestral land. Did they then give up upon their dreams, lay down their blades, and surrender themselves to those who would see them killed for what they believe? If they had, I would not be standing before you today as a free kirin.'\n\n'Instead, they left for lands unknown, across an uncertain sea with no clear idea of what terrors would await them on the other side. Yet what they found here was not just a dangerous wilderness, but instead a bountiful and prosperous land gifted to us by the Gods, upon which they sought to build our Republic. They were blessed for their exile, rather than punished for daring to oppose the authorities which sought to oppress them.'\n\n'Yet in recent years, it seems many within our holy nation would have spit upon our founders and their ideals - the very ideals favored by the Gods themselves! I hear your protests now, but let me ask you this... How is it right that we should treat ponykind, our dear siblings who only seek to play their part within the World Play, with nothing but contempt when their situation has grown so similar to our own? Do they not now seek to flee an oppressive regime, to seek a new land of freedom and harmony, just as we once did?'\n\n'The next time you see a pony in your neighborhood, I want you to remember that their situation is not so foreign to us. Appreciate them and embrace them, for they are blessed in their exile and perhaps one day they too shall forge a new homeland to call their own. Thank you.'"

The NRP holds faith, order, and purity above all. As their influence and sway has grown, they've also found themselves capable of supporting their own political militia organization - the so-called 'Blue Flames', named for many of their most zealous members tendency to turn into niriks at the slightest provocation. With the election well underway, a public rally by the NRP was not unexpected, but few could foresee the form it would take.\n\n'We demand you leave our land! We demand you leave our land!' These chants and many more rang out across the capital city of Kurida, as tens of thousands of kirin marched through the city streets. Commerce had been slowed to a halt, numerous otherwise bustling marketplaces were closed, and any ponies unfortunate enough to find themselves out in the mess were often harassed or outright assaulted by the reactionary mobs. In the midst of it all, the Kurdian Central Police struggled to maintain order.\n\nIn one particular incident, a group of Blue Flames broke into, vandalized, and looted a store belonging to an elderly pony couple. The ponies were saved from any further violence against them by the rapid response of law enforcement, and that would had been the end of this incident, if not for the subsequent arrival of Leaf Blaze. Standing before her followers, she glared at the police standing in front of the recently assaulted business before speaking.\n\n'Look now at the lizard-blooded dogs who protect these invaders! Do you see what our government does, what our elected officials allow? Violence, directed not against the vermin who infest our streets and steal our money while our poor starve, but against upstanding kirin who would give their lives to help our great nation! No more, no more, I say! Ponykind will never again be welcome here, after they dared reveal their true nature as scoundrels and theives, as criminals and swindlers, as invaders and parasites! Our founders built a land for kirin and by kirin, as blessed by the Gods Above! To tarnish their ideals by allowing such filth to plague us is an affront to all that is Holy! Soon, we shall reclaim our nation, reclaim our pride, and reclaim our future!'\n\nWith her impromptu speeches conclusion, Blaze led the gathered crowd further into the capital and away from the storefront, much to the relief of the vastly outnumbered police protecting it."

 esu_start.2.d:0 "The city of Yorii was a particularly diverse one, being home to the single largest population of ponies within the nation. It was also renown for it's relatively lax voting laws, allowing a far higher amount of the population to vote than any other city. Their location close to the border with Avtukia has also led to them becoming home to a sizable armory, weapons manufacturing sector, and military infrastructure. All this combined made it a critical city for the nation, but the National Rebirth Party would again catch most of the nation by surprise when they concentrated most of their forces there on election day, rather than in the more strategic and populated Kurida. Though the reason for this would soon become apparent.\n\nIt started simply enough and in a way which most would expect. Several violent protests occured across the city, with partipants encouraged to take out their woes on any ponies that could be found. Voting booths were often patrolled by Blue Flames, who would harass and often outright assault any ponies trying to cast their own votes. Several standoffs against the local police occured throughout the morning, but the NRP rabble rousers often conceeded and dispersed under pressure from law enforcement. That is, until the afternoon.\n\nWhat began as yet another standoff with the by-then very overworked law enforcement took a turn for the worse with the arrival of another local militia - the Liberty Party affiliated Ootarian Unification Front. The situation then quickly escalated into an allout brawl between the two forces, with the police being caught in the middle of it. All across the city, similar situations began to play out, and the violence steadily escalated until the point of full blown riots and attacks against government buildings.\n\nIt wasn't long before the local military garrison was being deployed to help protect local officials and support law enforcement. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the NRP wanted. With the garrison stretched thin, they were unable to effectively respond when the Blue Flames stormed the Yorii Armory, one of the most well stocked and modern in the nation. The small force left protecting the armory fought against the unexpected attack with fury and zeal, and in doing so they were..."

Thousands were detained, stretching the local jails to well beyond their limit and forcing the city government to establish several temporary holding areas. Numerous ponies and kirin alike were killed in the fighting with immense damage being done across the city. In response to all this carnage, a day of rememberance was declared across the nation. Due to their role in promoting, participating in, and causing the violence, the National Rebirth Party was declared an illegitimate political organization and suspended by an Emergency Act of Parliament. With this, the Liberty Party was cemented as the new leaders of Esun.\n\nIn his inauguration address, Apple Forest promised that those responsible for the tragedy in Yorii would all be brought to justice and went on to call for a period of mourning for those lives lost within the chaos. Outlining the shocking horrors of the conflict, he also called for sanity to be restored across the nation and for kirin to join hooves with ponykind in friendship rather than allow themselves to devolve to such barbarism."

Countless pony neighborhoods were razed to the ground, numerous public officials and law enforcement officers were killed, and the local garrison was largely scattered to the winds. As the sole victor, the NRP's official stance as correlated by numerous kirin supportive of their movement was that the Liberty Party started the escalation of violence through the OUF, who quickly joined forces with local pony gangs and sought to violently force a result in the election. Fortunately, the brave and upstanding members of the Blue Flame were ready to stand up for their nations democratic traditions. Through a night of heoric battle, they reclaimed the city and dealt with the threat to their society. Of course, given that they only fought in the name of democracy, it is only right that they made sure to preserve as many votes as possible. Votes which overwhelmingly faovred the NRP.\n\nDespite heavy protests from several members of Parliament, it was decided to accept the Yorii votes. Due to them, the NRP has managed to win the national election by a slim margin. In her inauguration address, Leaf Blaze thanked the upstanding kirin of the nation for their faith and promised to show the same faith in them, as she led the nation forward into a bright blessed future.

The southeast was part of Esun; but in words only. Two generations of removal from the original settlers from time Ootari was more united had devolved the clans in the middle of the continent to little more than robber barons; seeking to expand their own wealth at the expense of every equine around them.\n\n“Rest assured the clans will be reigned in my friends; you have my word.” Apple said, with practiced faux enthusiasm and a smile. The merchant Kirin seemed to accept his words but also see through the president’s enthusiasm, filing out and grudgingly albeit, leaving him to the affairs of state.\n\nApple Forest slumped in his chair. The warlords had made their position clear; they weren’t interested in following the authority of the republic and its leaders anymore. The army modernization and expansion programmes while underway; would not resolve the economic troubles brought on by the new bureaucratic “tolls,” forced upon merchants that once were able to cross through the republic’s land unhindered.\n\nLooking at the untouched pie on the center table that had been served for the meeting, Apple raised an eyebrow seeing that the server must have only been able to cut it three ways before being shooed out of the room. Apple looked at the pie and then the map on his office wall of Esun and lands it allegedly controlled and its two neighbors; the Kae Trade League and the Principality of Suatoa. Slowly a smile formed on his muzzle as he glanced at the pie and then the map again; before calling to his secretary.\n\n"

Prosecutor August Ember could almost pitied the raving revanchist mare. At least until this morning when secret documents of the society had been published in the national paper, detailing it’s centuries old history, political assassinations, and blood sacrifice. As Leaf Blaze teetered on the edge, August resolved to steady her; and make her jump into a noose of her own making.\n\n“We’ll never accept those ponies! Their barbarous ways! Their false sun god!” Leaf Blaze screeched; restrained by two bailiffs who placed her sitting back in the witness box. "Do you KNOW what they’ve done to our republic!? They’ve rewritten our history as if we were the aggressors!” Leaf Blaze’s angry muzzle wrinkled in sorrow. “You’re all on the wrong side! We’ve been fighting against these false narratives for centuries! W-why can’t you all see that?”Her head turned down and ears flattened.  “I-It can’t have been for nothing. W-we’ve sacrificed so-” She gulped. “So much. It can’t end here.”\n\nAugust stepped forwards, adjusting his monocle briefly. “Miss Leaf Blaze; your secret society has been laid to bare in full here.” He paused before the mare on the witness stand drawing a steady breath. “Did you and your society assassinate political leaders that did not align with your views for Kirin society on Luanservy?”\n\nLeaf Blaze nodded.\n\n“I will need a verbal answer, Miss Blaze.” August said loud enough for the gallery to hear.\n\n“Yes.” Leaf Blaze said somberly. “My society... and I... did assassinate political leaders.”\n\nThe gallery murmured quietly until two strikes of the judge’s gavel stilled the air of the courtroom once more.\n\nAugust waited for the silence to fill the air before asking the next question. “Miss Blaze.”August began, dreading the truthful answer more than the lie. “Did you and society...” Prosecutor August cleared his throat. “Sacrifice your fellow Kirin and fellow equines to the Moeru Hoshi?”\n\nThe courtroom hushed to a deafening silence.\n\nLeaf Blaze turned her head up to August, tired. “Yes.”"

Were it not for the dozen vanguard soldiers on either of her flanks she would have tipped over on her side. Rough looking Kirin peered down from the palisade battlewalls, eyeing her like a scrap of meat; catching the eye of one, she quickly turned her head forwards again to the castle’s ‘keep’ which was little more than a three story stone blockhouse for the leader of this group. Turning her muzzle to the white flag bearer to her side she gave a nod and the group stopped; waiting for the bandit leader to make his entrance.\n\nNearly half an hour later, several Kirin exited the stone blockhouse with one Kirin mare with a black eye leading the group. She snorted and huffed looking at Flowing Flame and the Vanguard escort, a wry smile on her face.\n\n“Name’s Flash Fire.” She snorted at the escort. “So old Esun’s coming out here to boonies, eh?” She said, spitting on the ground in front of Flowing Flame. “Whatchu want then?” She craned her neck back, eager to hear what the government would offer for the passage of caravans through her turf.\n\nGathering her resolve Flowing looked at her flag bearer, making him raise the white flag, and then at Flash Fire. “We offer amnesty to any and all bandits here in the region.” She looked at the blacked eyed kirin and then around to her subordinates and watching underlings. “You all will be permitted to ret-” Flowing was interrupted by Flash Fire storming up to her.\n\n“This your first bucking day negociating?” She said angrily pressing the tip of her muzzle against Flowing Flame’s. “We ain’t going nowhere; now buck off" She hissed.\n\nFlowing steadied herself, pushing back against Flash Fire. “Amnesty. Any kirin or pony who wants to take up the offer need merely exit this camp and they will be spared.”\n\nSeveral of the bandits chuckled and laughed with Flash Fire turning and dismissively flicking her tail at Flowing Flame. “That’s real buckin’ cute.” She turned to another bandit in her posse, “Blackburn, get this one to the-” Now Flash Fire was interrupted.\n\n“B-boss!” shouted one of the bandit sentries in alarm, looking at something beyond the wooden walls.\n\nTrudging up the parapet on the low palisade wall, Flash Fire looked out to the forest several hundred meters away. Battle formations of regular soldiers, militia and cannons stood well within firing range of her tiny demesne. Before she could verbalize her thoughts or command her fellows to anything, Flowing Flame words were shouted again; "We offer amnesty to any and all bandits here in the region.” She paused a moment then continued, “You all will be permitted to return to your homes with what belongings you can carry.”\n\nFlash Fire grit her teeth and snorted."

The vanguards protecting the negotiator had fought hard and well to hold their own ground but were ultimately overwhelmed and cut down, as the bandits dealt with the enemies in their walls before facing the army outside it.\n\nThe harsh reality of refusing the offer came not a few minutes after refusing Flowing Flame’s offer though; with the artillery battery outside the walls of the fortress targeting the gates and the stone blockhouse in short order. Flash Fire had commanded her sharpshooters to pick off the cannoneers; but they had barely time to fire a few shots before they too were picked off in turn. After the smoke cleared from the destroyed gatehouse, the army units outside made their play; with the grizzled sergeants leading an assault action straight through the destroyed gatehouse. Flash Fire had commanded her lackeys to get the cannon from the blockhouse but it was for naught as the aim of the howitzers outside found the mark of the powder storage room, blowing the stone structure in half.\n\nThe bandits had continued their resistance doggedly until the storming soldiers had breached the gates, shooting and bayonetting down any who put up resistance. As the battle quickly turned, kirin and ponies began to raise their forelegs to the sky in submission. Flash Fire cursed their cowardice but they didn’t keep their hooves in the air for long as a sergeant stuck a bayonet into the throat of one surrendering kirin. Panic and a second wind swept over the bandits as they saw the surrendering one get cut down all the same. Some on the wall opposite the gatehouse took their chance to scramble over the palisade and make a frenetic run to the forest, only to be caught and quartered with pleas for their lives. As the remaining bandits were culled Flash Fire caught a stray round to her hock and collapsed backwards. As she tumbled into the mud she looked around, nearly everypony she knew was dead and the soldiers were finishing off the stragglers. She glanced one last time at a wheezing Flowing Flame as the edge of her vision began to darken.\n\nFlash Fire gave one last crude smile to the wheezing negotiator before a kirin regular blocked the view of her and drove a bayonet into her forehead."

You have worked hard, fought against the conservative and prejudiced elements of your own fellow kirin and society, sometimes at great personal risk.\n\nI know every equine gets its words in the great play during their respective parts as it were, but actions speak louder; and good deeds must be rewarded.

 esu_sanelate.4.d:0 "“...And that is why both parties must listen. If too many Kirin and other faithful creatures are not permitted by their own Gods given time to balance the material world to enjoy the spiritual world; we will regress and become like those across the sea in Ijikami!” The pink maned priestess of Azuma; Rose, said before the quietly murmuring parliament. “This body must act to protect the common Kirin’s time and spiritual destiny.” Rose gave a bow of respect to the parliament, then stepped away from the podium. She was one of several dozen religious figures speaking to the New believer party and Nationalist coalition, arguing for better working hours for the working Kirin.\n\nThe bold plans of the new coalition had created many new jobs, but working hours would often mean many Kirin workers would still work from dawn to dusk. After several days of debate, a new bill was tabled: the Azuma Act, limiting the maximum working day to ten hours with exemptions in the case of some national defense industries, some religious positions and foreign invasion."

 esu_sanelate.6.d:0 "Report for The Backstage follows; Property Master Blue and Stage Manager Red reporting.\n\nGreetings Director! I’m glad to tell you that our endeavor to bring “The Homecoming,” to production is well underway! We’ve managed to find many interested locals for followspots and prop acquisition. We hope to have the script brought to Sunan where we have put together our small but growing theatre troupe. We find the local laws somewhat restrictive in what manner of productions we’ve been able to do thus far; but are very much excited to begin working on a more dramatic production. We do require some more modern tools to properly allow the stagehooves to act however, and we’d request that they be brought from stage right at your earliest convenience. Aside from our existing stagehooves have their time wholly occupied teaching the followspots the ins and outs of scene changes; all is well and our patrons are quite captivated, we see no need for an intermission.\n\nAll the best from stage left;\n\nProperty Master Blue\n\Stage Manager Red"

 esu_sanelate.7.t:0 "The First Day of Training"
 esu_sanelate.7.d:0 "Sergeant Major Greeneburn wanted to scream. The immigrant volunteers from Ijakami were illiterate, slow and completely unaware of the ways of modern warfare. This was the fourth company of the battalion he’d been inspecting since training started this morning and these manure-brained foals were wielding their rifles as clubs, same as the last three!\n\nATTENTION! He screamed, making the sparring company come to a pitiful formation. “You buckin’ idiots! Those are GUNS not CLUBS! You use them for BUCKIN’ SHOOTING!” The volunteers shrank from the Sergeant Major’s aggressive attitude. He got up close to one of the volunteers in formation, yanking the gun out of the volunteer’s hoof with his magic and stepped back. “ONE, rest; TWO, at ready; THREE firing position!” Greeneburn demonstrated the motions over and over, making the volunteers follow his commands in sync. Levitating the rifle back to the nervous volunteer he smiled briefly, feeling calm again.\n\nAt least until he heard and  turned to see the fifth and sixth companies engaged in a melee on the parade square using their rifles as clubs."
