###EVENT LOCALISATION - EARLYGAME###
 avt_event.0.t:0 "Winds of Change"
 avt_event.0.d:0 "January fourteenth, the day the Luanan empire collapsed into civil war with a deathrattle, and the Avtukian victory day celebration. Ivory Spark recast a warming spell on himself as he anxiously trotted by the open balcony; the cold breeze air running over his regalia as he mouthed the speech he had prepared in the presence of his Daughter, Elusive Gem. Below on the palace grounds, a massive crowd murmured with light interest despite the weather.\n\nOne of the captains of the palace entered the room just outside the balcony, standing at attention before Ivory and Elusive. Ivory turned to him and nodded. The officer spoke, “My Tsar. The courtyard is filled up and spilling out to the streets beyond the palace now. We’ve had to prevent more from entering, per your orders.” He gave a crisp stamp and salute to Ivory, before waiting.\n\nIvory smiled and nodded to the captain. “I will begin my speech momentarily, dismissed and thank you.” He returned a stamp and saluted the captain, who turned and departed.\n\nIvory was left alone with Elusive who looked quietly at the back of the departing captain’s head, before looking to her father a bit more hopeful. She curtsied before him, before moving to nuzzle lightly with him. “Goodluck, Father.” She said, quietly.\n\nIvory swallowed and nodded back, before stepping out into the cold breezy air on the balcony, joined by Princess Elusive, who in her royal Canterlot voice, addressed the murmuring and meandering crowd. “Ponies, deer, kirin and creatures of Avtukia!” She boomed into the courtyard, her voice carrying beyond, before turning to her father who stood center balcony. “By the Grace of the Sun, Tsar of all Avtukia and Grand Duke of Oskil! Ivory Spark!” She bowed respectfully to her father beside him.\n\nIvory swallowed one last time, before using the royal Canterlot voice himself. “My ponies, deer, kirin, and creatures!” He began. “I come to you, this day, our victory day over Luana, to speak to you. It’s been seventy six years since the end of the great war, and just over decade since the Gallundian’s attempted surprise war. Avtukia has prospered, minded its own business and kept its muzzle on the grindstone, but it’s also grown complacent, short sighted and in the worst of cases, indifferent.”\n\nHe paused for a moment. “We are Avtukians. We are a stubborn herd. We did not trot south to warmth. We went over the pole to find our respite. The Gallundians bray at our eastern borders, burghers and merchants attempt to seize noble privileges they have not earned, and nobles not worthy of their titles openly abuse my subjects. My ponies, my deer, my kirin, my creatures.” He took a moment to let that sink in over the crowd. “If stubbornness and indifference prevents my nobles from fulfilling their expectations, their duties. Then they will have to contend with MINE!” He spat out, venomously. “I, Tsar Ivory Spark make this vow to you here today; the nobility is hereby notified of its dereliction of duty to you my subjects. Today Avtukia is pulled from stubbornness!” He shouted with a commanding finish."

Beside her, Arctic Metal nodded slowly along with her. “They are PEASANTS!” She continued. “We are the leaders of the herd, we do not subordinate to-” Ivory interrupted her.\n\n“I am very serious, Elusive, Arctic.” He looked at his daughter and then brother. “We must stop abuses of the nobility while we have these precious years of good fortune. Not all have abandoned their duty, I am sure most can be motivated with their privileges and obligations.” He said more surely to the ponies at the table.\n\nMidnight Song and Flawless Dusk traded a mild glance to each other before Midnight spoke up, “My Tsar, the ponies in the courtyard were quite happy with your vow, but we should be concerned now. This will surely generate unrest among the more entrenched noble families.”\n\nFlawless Dusk followed up quickly behind her, “You’ve done excellent work in Gracemare, helping me straighten it out from the previous titleholder my Tsar.” She bowed her head. “But Princess Midnight is correct. If you intend to do what you did in Gracemare, across the Tsardom...” Her muzzle crinkled. “We will have a difficult task ahead of us-” She looked to Elusive and Arctic. “-Disagreements within the privy council not withstanding.”\n\nIvory Spark sighed, tapping his hoof on the table. “This is the path I wish to take-” He looked to Elusive and Arctic, slightly pained. “-Will you not trot it with me, Brother, Elusive?” His muzzle was tight but his eyes were hopeful.\n\nElusive merely snorted, curtsying to Ivory before turning and leaving the room, head held high. Arctic lingered a bit longer, ears wilting. “You’re really set on this, my Tsar?” Arctic asked his brother.\n\n“I am.” Ivory replied simply. “I would like to do it together.” He didn’t plead or beg but his muzzle told a different story.\n\n“I am sorry. I cannot help you, My Tsar. I must look after my own family as well too. The other nobles, they will fight you back on this with a ferocity much different than Gracemare.” He gave a pained look to Ivory, “You must know this...” He trailed off.\n\nIvory sighed, downcast before nodding. He waved a hoof to the door. “I cannot begrudge you for wanting to protect your family, brother. Go in peace.”\n\nArctic stamped and saluted to Ivory. “My Tsar.” He looked at Midnight and then Flawless. “Princess, Baroness.” He said, before leaving.\n\n“The common ponies are optimistic,-” Flawless began.\n\n“But you will have to proceed and show action, in the capital and beyond.” Midnight quickly followed up."

She set the book ‘One hundred and twenty days in tartarus’ facing away from where the servant would enter.\n\n“Enter.” Elusive spoke towards the door, not getting up from her ottomare.\n\nA timid looking servant earth mare entered, eyes down, carefully clutching a letter in her mouth and curtsying before Elusive before holding it out in her hoof to her, “I am to await your reply, my Princess.” The mare said, focused more on the floor than meeting Elusive’s hardening eyes.\n\nElusive took the letter, unsealing it with her magic and reading the contents to herself.\n\n“Dearest Princess and Niece, I must speak with you on a matter most urgent to the Tsardom of Avtukia. Please send your reply with the servant who presented this letter to you, she can be trusted. Meet with me under the willow tree in the southwest part of the gardens, tell no one else. Your Uncle, Grand Duke Arctic Metal.”\n\nElusive Gem narrowed her eyes, looking at the letter and then the mare who looked uneasy. “Please inform Grand Duke, that-”"
 avt_event.3.a:0 "I’ll attend"
 avt_event.3.b:0 "I don’t feel like going there."

 avt_event.4.t:0 "An Offer"
 avt_event.4.d:0 "There was only one willow tree in the southwest gardens. Elusive Gem walked at a sedate pace, making sure she wasn’t being followed or watched, then turning into a taller hedgerow. Taking a more brisk pace, she arrived at the willow tree and small pond it sat beside near the tall hedges. Three ponies were sitting on the pristine ground by the pathway; her Uncle Grand Duke Arctic Metal, her cousin, Duchess Lilac Snap and her third cousin Marchioness Windy March.\n\nApproaching her fellow peers, Elusive curtsied to them and received two curtsies and a stamp salute back. Her eyes shifted to Lilac and Windy then Arctic. “Cousins, Uncle.” She said curtly.\n\n“Cousin, it has been too long.” Lilac said with a genteel smile. “I was afraid you may not have attended but I’m glad to see my worries were for naught.”\n\nWindy cocked her head, offering a more cavalier smile. “Glad to have you with us, cousin.” She turned to Arctic.\n\nArctic waved Elusive closer, speaking in a quieter voice. “Niece. I must speak frankly and truly.” He drew an unsteady breath before looking Elusive squarely in the eyes. “Ivory will destroy us and the Avtukov dynasty with his quest to reform.” He held his hoof up to the side. “We’ve already seen his work in Gracemare. The majority of the nobility stripped of their titles, their families left with no recourse amongst their former peers. To say nothing of those given to the headmage’s horn.” He grimaced, shaking his head. “He will lead our family to ruin, the nobles will rally against him if he maintains this course and we will find ourselves in grave danger.”\n\nLilac turned to her, moving close to her left side. “I know how hard it must be for you to hear us conspire against your father so, Elusive.” She moved and placed a hoof on Elusive’s withers. “But he has always been obsessive with his designs and plans. He left you in my father and mother’s care after your mother.” Her voice became softer as she spoke. “He judges peers, quite unfairly and neglects his own duties, to you and to his family.”\n\nElusive couldn’t deny it, her father was obsessive, ever since her mother was assassinated, cool and distant, leaving her to be raised by Arctic Metal and Tulip Star. “What are you proposing?” She looked at each of them.\n\nWindy moved closer, sitting to the right beside her. “We will foalnap him, blame it on the other rebels, and in the chaos we will form a regency council; then confirm you as heir and the new Tsaritsa of Avtukov.” She tilted her head to Arctic and Lilac who both nodded in return.\n\n“This is not an easy decision, my niece.” Arctic said, moving in front of Elusive. “But we would not dare ask if we did not think the situation was so dire.” He held his breath for a moment. “We will meet again, in a fortnight, here to discuss the details.” He smiled weakly. “Will you help save our family from your father?”"

 avt_event.7.t:0 "One Last Threat Foiled"
 avt_event.7.d:0 "The willow tree’s branches swayed lightly in the breeze, a familiar trio of ponies under them as Elusive Gem stood near the exit of the hedgerows. The three, Arctic Metal, Lilac Snap and Windy March all turned to face Elusive as she paused, stamp saluting and curtsying. There was a pregnant pause for a few seconds, until Ivory Spark came around the corner, joining his daughter. Arctic metal went white faced, Lilac shifted back on her hooves uneasily looking horrified between Elusive and Ivory while Windy March’s wings extended, ready to take flight.\n\nEarth pony and unicorn guards started to emerge from around other exits and from behind Ivory and Elusive in addition to pegasi flying over. The trio looked around for a few seconds while Arctic turned to his daughter, hugging her while she made a strangled crying noise and Windy March folded her wings, looking at the ground.\n\nElusive’s breath caught as Ivory stepped around her slowly, as Arctic managed to help Lilac compose herself. Arctic wheeled around and walked confidently towards Ivory, meeting him halfway between the pair and Elusive.\n\n“I don’t know what the Princess has told you, my Tsar, but this gathering was my doing, and my responsibility. I was merely doing what I thought was right for the Avtukov family.” Arctic said, meeting Ivory’s eyes with determination.\n\nIvory sighed, meeting Arctic’s gaze sorrowfully. “I know, brother. But I am the head of the family. I lead, and you follow.” He looked to Windy who couldn’t meet his eyes, and Lilac’s whose eyes begged him; ‘mercy’. Ivory smiled at Lilac, who started to cry, covering her eyes with a foreleg.\n\nArctic’s muzzle dipped and he looked to the ground. “You are truly set on this path…” He spared a glance back to Ivory. “I can’t follow, brother.” Arctic tilted his head to Lilac.\n\n“I know.” Ivory closed the distance, and Arctic prostrated himself before Ivory before his brother hauled up back to his hooves. “And I won’t ask you to follow. But I won’t let you stand in my way either.” He paused for a moment. “You, Lilac, Windy and any of the other co-conspirator Avtukovs will be held at the summer palace.” He frowned, looking harder at Arctic. “Any other Avtukovs who fail to come forward after this, will not be treated with a velvet hoof.”\n\nArctic nodded immediately. “I understand.” He motioned for Lilac and for Windy to follow. Both did so immediately.\n\n“Thank you, My Tsar.” Windy said, bowing before him, before walking to the guards off to the side.\n\nLilac was next, she moved and bowed, tears still leaking from her eyes. “T-thank you, my Tsar.” Arctic steadied her, hooking a foreleg around hers, and helped to lead to the guards with Windy.\n\nElusive watched, as the closest thing to a sister and real father were led away by the guardsponies and Ivory spoke with the pegasus captain who landed close to him. She sighed, and then turned, disappearing back into the hedgerows, not seeing Ivory watch her slowly and quietly go."
