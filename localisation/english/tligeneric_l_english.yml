###GENERIC IDEOLOGY FOCUS###
 genfoc_defining_our_future:0 "Defining our Future"
 genfoc_defining_our_future_desc: "The future stands before us, vast and unknown. It is a sea full of endless possibilities, yet also one rife with endless danger. We will have to tread carefully as we march into the future, lest we be left stranded at sea without a life line."
 genfoc_on_the_warpath:0 "On the Warpath"
 genfoc_on_the_warpath_desc:0 "Our foes surround us, seeking to destroy our way of life and burn our nation into the ground. We must not allow this to pass. We are left with no choice but to strike first, to save our nation and people from certain annihilation."
 genfoc_aggressive_expansion:0 "Aggressive Expansion"
 genfoc_aggressive_expansion_desc:0 ""
 genfoc_glorious_conquest:0 "Glorious Conquest"
 genfoc_glorious_conquest_desc:0 ""
 genfoc_our_government:0 "Our Government"
 genfoc_our_government_desc:0 "What better defines our people than those who lead them? It is our government which seeks to guide, lead, and protect those under their reign. Any change we wish to enact across society will need to be enacted first as the level of governance."
 genfoc_despotism:0 "One Voice, One Will"
 genfoc_despotism_desc:0 "Our beloved and benevolent leader is the representative of our entire nation. Therefore, they are the voice of our entire people. Their perspective is the only one which matters, so there is no point in listening to any other."
 genfoc_despotism_buff_1:0 "Royal Guard"
 genfoc_despotism_buff_1_desc:0 "The standard military can not be trusted to hold the interests of our nation at heart. In order to safeguard our future, we must empower a group of committed individuals who swear their very lives to the cause of our leader and, by extension, our people."
 genfoc_despotism_buff_2:0 "The State Personified"
 genfoc_despotism_buff_2_desc:0 "What need have we for petty politics and pointless bickering? Our nation has one leader and one leader alone, who can be trusted to know what is best for us in every situation. We must trust in them to lead us forward, as without trust we can't survive as a society."
 genfoc_oligarchy:0 "Rule of the Elite"
 genfoc_oligarchy_desc:0 "Those with the highest stakes in our nation should be the ones to lead us into the future. Landowners, industrialists, and nobles alike can be trusted to see to our best interests, as they are also their own personal interests as well."
 genfoc_oligarchy_buff_1:0 "Nepotism"
 genfoc_oligarchy_buff_1_desc:0 "There is nothing wrong with investing trust in those you know to be trustworthy. The fact that they're related to you or have been your friends since childhood is just all the more reason to trust them, as you know them better than any stranger off the street."
 genfoc_oligarchy_buff_2:0 "Police State"
 genfoc_oligarchy_buff_2_desc:0 "The safety and security of our communities must be maintained at all costs. How can a society function when we can't even go outside without fear of being robbed? The answer is that it can't."
 genfoc_aristocracy:0 "The Natural Order"
 genfoc_aristocracy_desc:0 "There exists within our nation a group of individuals whose families have committed themselves to seeing to the needs of our population as a whole. These dynasties may have their flaws, but nobody else has come even close to proving themselves as much as our entrenched nobility. With this in mind, we should trust in them to lead us forward into a glorious new future."
 genfoc_aristocracy_buff_1:0 "Stratified Society"
 genfoc_aristocracy_buff_1_desc:0 "There exist a great many peoples within our nation who care primarily for their own personal interests over anything else. If we were to allow them to hold any sort of say within governance, we would be inviting nothing but disaster. We must ensure that only those who can be trusted are allowed to hold any sort of influence."
 genfoc_aristocracy_buff_2:0 "Economic Consolidation"
 genfoc_aristocracy_buff_2_desc:0 "Once upon a time, only those of proper heritage held positions of wealth within our society. Unfortunately, the modern day has ushered in a new class of industrialists who have created their own wealth. Using their treasures, they have begun to exert considerable influence over our society. We must stop them before they reduce us to nothing more than a kleptocratic state of thieves and fiends."
 genfoc_auth_democracy:0 "The Ruler and the People"
 genfoc_auth_democracy_desc:0 "We must ensure that the will of the people is upheld above all. The only way to do this is to empower our duly elected leader to carry out his responsibilities in seeing that the popular will ie enacted. A weak government is a sign of a weak people, incapable of doing what they desire."
 genfoc_auth_democracy_buff_1:0 "Eternal Stability"
 genfoc_auth_democracy_buff_1_desc:0 "Stability is important to every aspect of our society. The economy, the government, and the people alike all desire a calm life free of strife. It is our duty to do everything in our power to ensure that they can have this, for we would be a brutal tyrant to do otherwise. Crime, chaos, and disidence must not be allowed to take root if we are to ensure a stable and prosperous nation until the end of time."
 genfoc_auth_democracy_buff_2:0 "Scientific Patronage"
 genfoc_auth_democracy_buff_2_desc:0 "Technology is a means through which we may better the lives of all of our people. By investing in those who promise innovation, we are ensuring the continued rise of our future standards of living. There is nothing more commendable."
 genfoc_democracy:0 "By the People, For the People"
 genfoc_democracy_desc:0 "Why would we trust mere individuals to carry out the will of the people? Our state must be guided by ballots cast by each citizen, so as to ensure that they all have a say in the future of themselves and their families."
 genfoc_democracy_buff_1:0 "Fight for the Ideal"
 genfoc_democracy_buff_1_desc:0 "Freedom, liberty, and justice. These ideals are greater than any of us and indeed greater than our very nation as a whole. We must do everything in our power to defend and expand these ideals as we march forward into a brighter future for everyone."
 genfoc_democracy_buff_2:0 "The Citizen State"
 genfoc_democracy_buff_2_desc:0 "Our state is one whole comprised of many parts. Each and every citizen is one of those parts, an immense army of tiny cogs in one great machine which seeks to provide for them all. They all live, work, and die in prosperous freedom."
 genfoc_anarchy:0 "Devolve the Government"
 genfoc_anarchy_desc:0 "We can not trust any organization or entity to hold power over the people without inevitably oppressing them. Be it monarchy, meritocracy, or even democracy, each and every form of government is nothing but an enemy to the commoner. Therefore, the only solution is to do away with the governing entity altogether so as to ensure true freedom for all."
 genfoc_anarchy_buff_1:0 "Abolish Institutions"
 genfoc_anarchy_buff_1_desc:0 "It is not just the government which we must be wary towards. Businesses, universities, guilds, and any other sort of organized entity present a severe direct threat to our future liberty. They must all be abolished, for the good of all! No more hierarchy, no more oppression!"
 genfoc_anarchy_buff_2:0 "Militia Dependence"
 genfoc_anarchy_buff_2_desc:0 "Armies may be tools of oppression, but militias are comprised and led solely by those who they seek to protect. They will become our prefered means through which to repel any foreign oppressor which seeks to destroy our peaceful way of life. For the common good!"
 genfoc_looking_outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
 genfoc_looking_outwards_desc:0 "The world is a big place and our part of it is relatively small. There are all sorts of other nations and peoples out there, all unique in their own ways. Many of them may be willing to cooperate with us, but just as many would see us brought low and subjugated. We must decide how to conduct ourselves on the global stage so as to secure our continued existance."
 genfoc_militarism:0 "Might Makes Right"
 genfoc_militarism_desc:0 "The strong rule while the weak suffer. This is the unfortunate truth of the world in which we find ourselves. We didn't write the rules, but we will do everything in power to ensure that we come out on top."
 genfoc_militarism_buff_1:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
 genfoc_militarism_buff_1_desc:0 "Common security is something that is important to each and every individual, be they the poorest farmer or the richest industrialist. As a result, it only makes sense for us to pressure as many as possible to join in the defence of our nation against any who may seek us harm."
 genfoc_militarism_buff_2:0 "A Militarised Economy"
 genfoc_militarism_buff_2_desc:0 "The economy does not exist to create wealth for a select few individuals. Rather, it exists as a means through which wealth may be distributed for the good of the whole. Towards this end, we shall begin reallocating the means of production towards seeing to our common safety, as nothing is more important."
 genfoc_imperialism:0 "To Build an Empire"
 genfoc_imperialism_desc:0 "If we wish to secure a legacy to last, we must first begin by building a foundation for the future. To do so, we must expand our holdings and seize more resources with which to develop our nation into a truly mighty empire. There will soon come a time where our name is renown far and wide as one of the greatest civilizations to have ever existed."
 genfoc_imperialism_buff_1:0 "Rule the Waves"
 genfoc_imperialism_buff_1_desc:0 "The ocean is a vast realm of endless opportunity. Risks and rewards alike infest those waters, waiting for an emergent nation such as ourselves to come across them. We must see to it that we have a force capable of securing our travel across those wild seas, no matter what may seek to endanger our brave sailors."
 genfoc_imperialism_buff_2:0 "Colonial Recruitment"
 genfoc_imperialism_buff_2_desc:0 "As our nation expands, there will inevitably grow two classes of people: Those who are native to our Homeland and those who are not. This later group, though they may be looked down upon for their unfortunate heritage, are still entirely capable of fighting in service of our further expansion. In doing so, they might even earn the respect of our native citizens."
 genfoc_visionarism:0 "Protectors of the Isles"
 genfoc_visionarism_desc:0 "It is the duty of every capable nation to see to the protection of every incapable one. We must take up the mantle as the protector of the known world, for who else would be willing to pursue this selfless cause? Let it be known that we are committed to ensuring a shared peace and prosperty across the entirety of the Isles and beyond."
 genfoc_visionarism_buff_1:0 "One Struggle"
 genfoc_visionarism_buff_1_desc:0 "Rich, poor, native, immigrant, monarchist, anarchist. These are all nothing more than surface-level differences between us. Yet what unites us all as one nation is a shared goal, a goal to forge a better world for everyone. So let us set aside these petty conflicts that have divided us for so long and instead pursue a cause greater than ourselves."
 genfoc_visionarism_buff_2:0 "Peacekeeping Corps"
 genfoc_visionarism_buff_2_desc:0 "Despite what we may wish, war continues to cause untold amounts of destruction all across the Isles. Though we may not yet be in a position to stop every conflict from occuring, we can do our part to help enforce stability across the world and oppose those who would seek destruction."
 genfoc_solidarism:0 "Together Into a Bright Future"
 genfoc_solidarism_desc:0 "Many within our nation think only of the past. In all matters, they consider nothing but tradition and heritage. Though these arguments may hold merit in some regards, they are entirely pointless when it comes to the matter of our future. As the world changes around us, so too must we change as we march towards the horizon."
 genfoc_solidarism_buff_1:0 "Technology Sharing"
 genfoc_solidarism_buff_1_desc:0 "In recent years, technology has begun to boom all across the Isles. Scientific innovations that would have been regarded as impossible feats of magic a few generations ago are now becoming common place. This technology has been shown to greatly increase the quality of life for everyone, leaving us with hope and optimism for the future. It is only rational that we invest in this means to revolutionize our way of living."
 genfoc_solidarism_buff_2:0 "Diplomatic Corps"
 genfoc_solidarism_buff_2_desc:0 "Why have war when we could have peace? Through determined diplomacy, we are confident in our ability to establish a lasting relationship with those who we can confidentally call our friends. Through these relations, it is our hope to create a common wealth for all involved and to better the world as a whole."
 genfoc_continuism:0 "Preserving our Sphere"
 genfoc_continuism_desc:0 "Ambitious dreams for the future are great and all, but they fail to address the realities of our situation. We are fortunate to have as much as we do and we must take every measure possible to maintain it. Our grandchildren will grow up in the same nation we did, holding our values and continuing our way of life."
 genfoc_continuism_buff_1:0 "Deterrence"
 genfoc_continuism_buff_1_desc:0 "Many would see us brought to harm, our homes razed and our children killed in cold blood. We will not let this come to pass. Our military must stand ready at all times to defend our nation. Those who would destroy us should be made very aware that every step they make into our land will be paid for tenfold with their blood."
 genfoc_continuism_buff_2:0 "Sphere Consolidation"
 genfoc_continuism_buff_2_desc:0 "Why would we meddle in the affairs of far off governments when we should instead be focusing on the well being of our own people? Our focus must be clearly defined, for the sake of the continued prosperity of our nation. So long as we remain in power, our citizens will remain our highest priority."
 genfoc_isolationism:0 "Splendid Isolation"
 genfoc_isolationism_desc:0 "The world is immense, dangerous, and immensely dangerous. With threats all around us and more threats around them, we are left with little choice but to bunker down and weather the storm of time. Let the fires of war rage on all across the Isles, but we will remain happy and alive within our peaceful nation."
 genfoc_isolationism_buff_1:0 "Fortification Focus"
 genfoc_isolationism_buff_1_desc:0 "Though we are taking every measure to avoid crossing paths with trouble, it may find us regardless. When that time comes, we must be prepared to repel any army thrown at us. Towards this end, we will begin the construction of immense fortifications all across our territory. Let them come, for we will take not one step back!"
 genfoc_isolationism_buff_2:0 "Inwards Perfection"
 genfoc_isolationism_buff_2_desc:0 "It's amazing how much you can accomplish when you stop worrying about the entire world and only focus on your own slice of it instead. Armies could be fighting and dying at our doorstep, but we will remain here where we are safe and comfortable. In a thousand years time, long after the 'mighty' empires have turned to dust, our people will still be here."
 genfoc_soul_of_nation:0 "The Soul of our Nation"
 genfoc_soul_of_nation_desc:0 "As we move forward, we must keep in mind the greater spiritual ideals which bond our people together as one. Without a shared attunement, we shall drift apart from one another and inevitably fall to strife."
 genfoc_regressive:0 "A Return to the Past"
 genfoc_regressive_desc:0 "Our ancestors built a legacy and it is our duty to continue it. Let them look upon us now from wherever they may reside and see their dreams be accomplished by their grandchildren."
 genfoc_regressive_buff_1:0 "Society of Priests"
 genfoc_regressive_buff_1_desc:0 "The clergy know our tradition and history greater than anyone else, for it is them who have maintained their holy records since the beginning of recorded time. We owe them the greatest level of respect as the keepers of our past."
 genfoc_regressive_buff_2:0 "Eternal Tradition"
 genfoc_regressive_buff_2_desc:0 "Once upon a time, our founders had a dream. A dream of a better world, one that would prosper for the rest of time. Let it be known that their dream shall not die with us, our children, nor even our grand children! Let our nation stand as a monument to them!"
 genfoc_reactionary:0 "Preserve Our Culture"
 genfoc_reactionary_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that not all of the changes being wrought across the Isles in our time is positive. Many new ideas are directly harmful towards our people and threaten to destroy our very way of life. We must be careful moving forward, unless we wish to have our culture destroyed by foreign ideals."
 genfoc_reactionary_buff_1:0 "Species Supremacy"
 genfoc_reactionary_buff_1_desc:0 "It was our kind who built this nation, no other. As we know, our land is the greatest across all of the Isles. With these two facts in mind, the only obvious conclusion becomes that all other creatures are incapable of creating a beacon of civilization that could compare with our own."
 genfoc_reactionary_buff_2:0 "Destroy the Dissidents"
 genfoc_reactionary_buff_2_desc:0 "There exist many who doubt the 'radical' measures they accuse us of taking. These neighsayers should be removed from our society as quickly and efficiently as possible, as allowing their sedition to seep into the public consciousness would spell our doom."
 genfoc_conservative:0 "Steady as She Goes"
 genfoc_conservative_desc:0 "Why rock the boat? Instead of implementing some radical societal change, we will simply continue on the course that we are on. The simplest way forward is often the best."
 genfoc_conservative_buff_1:0 "To Defend our Home"
 genfoc_conservative_buff_1_desc:0 "One thing we can all agree on is the importance of maintaining the security of our homeland. We should remind our people of this, as it is ultimately their land which is at risk should a foreign threat invade us."
 genfoc_conservative_buff_2:0 "Promote Prosperity"
 genfoc_conservative_buff_2_desc:0 "A well functioning and efficient economy is key to any society. We will do our best to encourage a shared ideal of economic prosperity, encouraging our citizens to seek functional jobs and do their part to increase productivity."
 genfoc_progressive:0 "To Repair our Society"
 genfoc_progressive_desc:0 "We have found ourselves damaged by misguided religious sects and radical concepts that would see our entire way of life upturned. Thankfully, this damage is repairable. All we must do is come together in unity and seek a better path, one built on improving everyones lives."
 genfoc_progressive_buff_1:0 "From the Frontline to the Schoolyard"
 genfoc_progressive_buff_1_desc:0 "Sending our children to die in brutal conflict might suit our more conservative rivals just fine, but we would much prefer to teach them to read and provide them with the opportunity to better themselves."
 genfoc_progressive_buff_2:0 "Enviromental Protection"
 genfoc_progressive_buff_2_desc:0 "This is our land and we should take pride in it! Rather than destroying it and exploiting it for everything it has, we should instead take care to preserve it as best as we can. Let our children have something left to inherit."
 genfoc_revolutionary:0 "Redifining our Values"
 genfoc_revolutionary_desc:0 "Clearly, the ideals we have held so far have been lacking in many ways. This is an ever-changing world and we must change with it if we are to survive into the future. Let them call us radicals, traitors, and whatever else they would like to throw at us! We shall wear those titles with pride as we seek to free our society from the shackles of the past."
 genfoc_revolutionary_buff_1:0 "Species Equality"
 genfoc_revolutionary_buff_1_desc:0 "True equality for all is an ideal that many claim to hold, yet they would call a pony and a griffon unequal. Well, no more! All shall be the same within our nation, regardless of how many talons, hooves, or antlers they may have!"
 genfoc_revolutionary_buff_2:0 "Defending the Revolution"
 genfoc_revolutionary_buff_2_desc:0 "Our ideals are under attack from all sides! They seek to destroy us, to oppress us, and to extinguish the flame of revolutionary ideals which we have sparked. We shall not let them! Millions will be sacrificed if that is what it takes to protect our shared movement."
 genfoc_futurist:0 "Destroy the Present"
 genfoc_futurist_desc:0 "Past? Present? These are nothing but words. The only thing of actual tangible value is the future, which awaits us with its golden treasure"
 genfoc_futurist_buff_1:0 "Society of Artists"
 genfoc_futurist_buff_1_desc:0 "What need have we for the soldier, the farmer, the preacher, or the politician? All of these roles are arbitrary, a flawed method of categorizing our people into nonsensical positions of made up social status. Let it be known that the only job of true value is that of the artist! Culture shall flow, and from it all problems shall be solved."
 genfoc_futurist_buff_2:0 "§YFaster!§! §OFaster!§! §RFaster!§!"
 genfoc_futurist_buff_2_desc:0 "§RThere is no such thing as too fast. We must progress, we must prosper, we must expand, we must conquer, we must control, we must thrive, we must survive, we must live, we must die. There is no end in sight, no light at the end of this infinitely long tunnel. Yet we shall carry on, we shall continue to move, for there is only one direction to go and it is forward.§!"
 genfoc_matters_of_economy:0 "Our Economy"
 genfoc_matters_of_economy_desc:0 "The economy is one of the core pillars of our nation, creating the conditions for our peoples continued growing prosperity. It is only natural that our citizenry would seek a cohesive economic policy from our government so that we may help ensure our peoples growth into the future."
 genfoc_collective:0 "Complete Control"
 genfoc_collective_desc:0 "It is the duty of the government to oversee the wellbeing of all of her citizens. This would imply overseeing all economic affairs, as they are of crucial concern to our people. There should be no private ventures, as the economy is everyones concern."
 genfoc_collective_buff_1:0 "Economic Micromanagement"
 genfoc_collective_buff_1_desc:0 "Every aspect of the economy must be under direct government oversight. The factories, the overseers, and the workers alike all must be put under public control to ensure that they only act in ways which is beneficial to the common good."
 genfoc_collective_buff_2:0 "Maximised Efficiency"
 genfoc_collective_buff_2_desc:0 "Every gear must turn in sync, every worker must do their duty, and every quota must be met. Only in this way can we ensure that the trains run on time and the people get their daily bread. Industry shall carry on steadily and efficiently, so that all of our future expectations for growth may be met."
 genfoc_mercantilism:0 "Mercantilism"
 genfoc_mercantilism_desc:0 "Our industry is the envy of the world! Let all across the Isles partake in our goods, consuming the fruit of our labor and in turn providing us with bountiful wealth. It is in our interest to provide for the needs of all across the world, be they needs of survival or illusive desires of luxury. The cash shall flow towards us and us alone."
 genfoc_mercantilism_buff_1:0 "Export Subsidies"
 genfoc_mercantilism_buff_1_desc:0 "Given that continued trade with external markets is in the common economic interest of our people, it only goes to reason that it is within the states right and, one could argue, the states obligation to provide reasonable investments towards promoting trade. Soon, our economy will stand as one of the greatest in the world."
 genfoc_mercantilism_buff_2:0 "Wealth Creation"
 genfoc_mercantilism_buff_2_desc:0 "The wealth of our people is one of the greatest things we could strive for. Let the money flow! As other nation's citizens enjoy our products, our own will enjoy bountiful riches and luxurious living standards."
 genfoc_feudalism:0 "Feudalism"
 genfoc_feudalism_desc:0 "It is the commoners lot to toil, just as it is the aristocrats lot to lead. To stray from this path is to invite ruin to our country and people. We must seek to enforce an economic structure which puts everyone in their proper place, so as to ensure they all fulfill the roles which are afforded to them by their birthright."
 genfoc_feudalism_buff_1:0 "Extraction Focus"
 genfoc_feudalism_buff_1_desc:0 "Though traditional feudalism focused primarily on agricultural land, we have found ourselves in a more modern age calling for a more modern policy. Land rights take second place to resource rights, as the landlords of today will be known for their access to raw natural riches as opposed to vast fields."
 genfoc_feudalism_buff_2:0 "Rural Development"
 genfoc_feudalism_buff_2_desc:0 "Let there be no mistake. While we may seek to promote a more modern view of traditional feudalist economics, we will not simply abandon the benefits of the past. A sizable investment will be made in propping up vast rural farmlands, which may help ensure that prosperity is shared across our entire nation."
 genfoc_oligopoly:0 "Consolidated Market"
 genfoc_oligopoly_desc:0 "Though it may be important for the economy to remain relatively free, it is equally important that we ensure it serves our nation's interests as we seek to make our way in the world. Towards this end, we will make sure those at the top are those we can trust. Family, friends, and government officials alike will all share in the wealth."
 genfoc_oligopoly_buff_1:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
 genfoc_oligopoly_buff_1_desc:0 "To further ensure the market benefits our people, we will encourage extensive cooperation between our patriotic industiralists and our military leadership. All of our armies needs will be met by our committed business partners and they shall be provided for in turn. Such a relationship will be only to our benefit."
 genfoc_oligopoly_buff_2:0 "Corporatocracy"
 genfoc_oligopoly_buff_2_desc:0 "In our nation, we have no fear of corrupt capitalists nor greedy robberbarons seeking to undercut our good honest people. We can rest easy knowing that the corporations which control our economy are firmly committed to serving the public, just as the public will continue to serve them. Only in this way can we ensure our economy thrives in a way which is in line with our ideals."
 genfoc_capitalism:0 "Liberal Economics"
 genfoc_capitalism_desc:0 "Though intervention may sometimes be necessary, it is also equally necessary that the free exchange of goods be allowed. Minor regulations will remain, but for the most part our people will be allowed to trade freely."
 genfoc_capitalism_buff_1:0 "Nationwide Market"
 genfoc_capitalism_buff_1_desc:0 "As the market prospers, so too do our people. Towards this end, we will work on subsidizing those industries which are crucial to the continued health of the market. These investments should help ensure a stable supply chain which will facilitate further market expansion for decades to come."
 genfoc_capitalism_buff_2:0 "Equality of Opportunity"
 genfoc_capitalism_buff_2_desc:0 "Our nation is one where anyone can make their fortune through nothing more than dedication and hard work. Through their own merit, the most impoverished family may emerge as up and coming industrialists. Let it be known that there is prosperity aplenty for any with the will to seize it."
 genfoc_laissez_faire:0 "Let the Gold Flow"
 genfoc_laissez_faire_desc:0 "As modern economics has developed, it has unfortunately done so largely in a more interventionist direction. This is a great tragedy, as only through allowing the market to take its course can we ensure maximum prosperity and wealth. Let it be known that we reject the barbarism of our peers, but instead embrace a common trust in our people to make their own wealth."
 genfoc_laissez_faire_buff_1:0 "Cutthroat Competition"
 genfoc_laissez_faire_buff_1_desc:0 "Through pure merit, a select few may rise to the top. And through their hubris, they may find themselves cast back down to the bottom.
